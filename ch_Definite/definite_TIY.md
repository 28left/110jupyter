## Exercise 5
The marginal cost function associated with producing $x$ widgets is given by

$$C'(x) = -0.4x + 75$$

where $C'(x)$ is measured in dollars/unit and $x$ denotes the number of widgets. If the daily fixed costs incurred in the production amount to $\$600$, find the total cost incurred in producing the first 100 units of the day.
