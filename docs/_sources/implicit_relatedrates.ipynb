    "```{admonition} How to Solve a Related Rates Problem\n",
    ":class: info\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few guidelines to follow when solving a related rates problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assign a variable** to each quantity that changes and state the known and unknown rates of change with respect to time $t$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Find an equation** relating the variables. Don't forget about business models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Differentiate both sides** of the equation implicitly with respect to $t$. Treat all variables as functions of $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Replace the variables** and their derivatives by the numerical data given. Watch out for words like \"increasing\" or \"decreasing\", \"rising\" or \"falling\", \"away\" or \"towards\", etc. to determine if a derivative is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Solve the equation** for the unknown rate of change.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $p^2x + 6x = 5$ and $\\dfrac{dp}{dt} = 3$. Compute $\\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ when $p = 2$.\n",

    "```{admonition} Step 4: Since $x$ appears in the equation after differentiation, we need to find its value by plugging in $p=2$ into the given equation $p^2x + 6x = 5$.\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(2)^2x + 6x = 5 ~~~~~\\Rightarrow~~~~~ 10x = 5 ~~~~~\\Rightarrow~~~~~ x = 1/2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Step 5: Plug in the known values of the variables and their derivatives into the equation found in Step 3. ($p=2$, $x=1/2$, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 3$)\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2(2)(3)\\frac{1}{2} + (2)^2x' + 6x' = 0  ~~~~~\\Rightarrow~~~~~ 6 + 10x' = 0 ~~~~~\\Rightarrow~~~~~ x' = -3/5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = -3/5$ when $p=2$ and $\\dfrac{dp}{dt} = 3$.\n",

    "A company is decreasing the production of energy drinks at a rate of 100 cases per day. All cases produced can be sold. The daily demand function is given by \n",
