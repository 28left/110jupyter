    "# The Domain of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Definition\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "The **domain** of a function is the set of all values of $x$ for which the function is defined.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining the domain of a given function, do not include any value that leads to one or more of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- division by zero\n",
    "- the square root of a negative number\n",
    "- the logarithm of zero or a negative number\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should be familiar with the concepts of division and square roots.  Logarithms will be discussed in class and in a subsequent PSL Course Packet.   While there are other functions that lead to restrictions on the domain, we will limit our discussion to division, square roots, and logarithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interval Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain of a function is typically written as a union of intervals.  In this course, we will make use of interval notation to express domains.  This notation is summarized in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table of interval types](../images/pic_precalc_intervaltypes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two intervals, $A$ and $B$, then the union of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A\\cup B$, represents the collection of values that are in $A$ or in $B$.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(-\\infty,5) \\cup [7,10)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "represents the values that are less than $5$ (i.e., $x<5$) or greater than or equal to $7$ and less than $10$ (i.e., $7\\leq x < 10$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Use interval notation to describe the domain of $1/x$.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Step 1: Describe the domain of $1/x$ using an inequality.\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain of $1/x$ includes all real numbers except $x=0$ (i.e., $x<0$ or $x>0$) since division by zero is not defined. \n",

    "```{admonition} Step 2: Use interval notation to describe the domain of $1/x$.\n",

    "Use interval notation to describe the domain of $\\sqrt{x}$.\n",
