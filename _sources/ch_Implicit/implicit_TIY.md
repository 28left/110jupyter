# Try It Yourself

## Exercise 1
Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ where $y$ is defined implicitly by 

$$y^4 + x^3y^2 - x = 5.$$

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $(1 - 3x^2y^2)/(4y^3  + 2x^3y)$
```


## Exercise 2
Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve defined implicitly by 

$$x^4y-x^3+14y=29$$

at the point $(1,2)$.


```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $y=-x/3 + 7/3$
```


## Exercise 3
The demand equation for Hager & Little's *Better Business Calculus* book series is given by

$$p = -5x^2 - 2x + 100$$

where $p$ is the wholesale unit price in dollars and $x$ is the quantity demanded in units of a thousand.  Compute the elasticity of demand when $x=4$.


```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $1/14$
```


## Exercise 4
A company is increasing production of math-brain protein bars at a rate of 50 cases per day. All cases produced can be sold. The daily demand function is given by 

$$p(x) = 80 - \frac{x}{100}$$

Where $x$ is the number of cases produced and sold, and $p$ is in dollars. Find the rate of change of the revenue with respect to the time in days when daily production is 500 cases.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: revenue increases by \$3,500 per day
```


## Exercise 5
If the quantity demanded daily of a product is related to its unit price in dollars by 

$$p^2 = 106 - x^2$$

How fast is the quantity demanded changing when $x=5$ and the unit price is decreasing at a rate of \$3 per day.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: demand increases by $27/5$ units per day
```

## Exercise 6
The weekly demand function is given by 

$$p + x + 3xp = 43$$

where $x$ is the number of thousands of units demanded weekly and $p$ is in dollars. If the price is increasing at a rate of 20 cents per week when the level of demand is 4000 units, at what rate is the demand decreasing?

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: demand decreases by 260 units per week
```
