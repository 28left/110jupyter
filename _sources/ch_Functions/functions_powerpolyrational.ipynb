    "- The domain of a polynomial function is all real numbers.\n",
    "- The domain of a rational function, $f(x)/g(x)$, is all real numbers excluding values of $x$ such that $g(x) = 0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root function, $\\sqrt{x}$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "- a power function since $\\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$, but\n",
    "- is neither a polynomial nor a rational function since it includes a fractional power of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The reciprocal function, $\\dfrac{1}{x}$, is \n",
    "\n",
    "- a power function since $\\dfrac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$, and \n",
    "- is also a rational function since it is the ratio of two polynomials, but \n",
    "- is not a polynomial since it includes a negative power of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\dfrac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, which is a power function, a polynomial, and a rational function in the variable $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = (x^2 + 7)(x^3 - 1)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "is a polynomial (and therefore also a rational function) and determine its degree.\n",

    "Since $f$ can be written as a sum of power functions where every power of $x$ is a nonnegative integer, $f$ is a polynomial.\n",

    "```{admonition} Step 2: Determine the degree of $f$.\n",

    "In the previous example, the degree of the polynomial could have been determined by adding the degrees of the individual factors.  More specifically, $f$ is the product of a polynomial of degree 2 (i.e., $x^2 + 7$) and a polynomial of degree 3 (i.e., $x^3-1$).  Therefore, the degree of $f$ is the sum of $2$ and $3$, which is $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a product of polynomials is also a polynomial and its degree is the sum of the degrees of the polynomial factors.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that $g(x) = \\dfrac{4}{x-1} + \\dfrac{5}{x}$ is a rational function (but not a polynomial) and determine its domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Step 1: Get a common denominator.\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{4}{x-1} + \\dfrac{5}{x} = \\frac{4x}{x(x-1)} + \\frac{5(x-1)}{x(x-1)}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{4x + 5(x-1)}{x(x-1)} = \\frac{9x-5}{x(x-1)}$$\n",

    "Since $g(x)$ can be written as a ratio of polynomials, it too is a rational function.\n",

    "Since $g$ is the sum of two functions, we begin by considering the domain of each of the two functions.  Specifically, the domain of $4/(x-1)$ consists of all real numbers except $x=1$ and the domain of $5/x$ consists of all real numbers except $x=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the domain of $g$ consists of all real numbers except $x=0$ and $x=1$.  In interval notation, this can be written as\n",
