## Exercise 1
The weekly demand for Math-Hero video games is given by 

$$p=x^3âˆ’150x+1000$$

where $x$ is the number of video games produced and sold, and $p$ is in dollars. Using the 
marginal revenue function, $R'(x)$, approximate the marginal revenue when 10 Math-Hero video games have been produced and sold and interpret the result.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $\$2000$, revenue increases by about $\$2000$ when weekly sales increase from 10 to 11 
```


## Exercise 2
The weekly demand for Math Wars - Return of the Calculus video games is given by 

$$p= \frac{250}{x-5} + 3500$$

where $x$ is the number thousands of video games produced and sold, and $p$ is in dollars. 

Using the marginal revenue function, $R'(x)$, approximate the marginal revenue when 10,000 
video games have been produced and sold and interpret the result.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $\$3450$, revenue increases by about $\$3450$ when weekly sales increase from 10,000 to 11,000
```


## Exercise 3
The daily cost (in dollars) of producing LCD ultra-high definition televisions is given by 

$$C(x)= 5x^3 - 50x^2 + 50x + 2500$$

where $x$ denotes the number of thousands of televisions produced in a day. 

Using the 
marginal average cost function, $\overline{C}'(x)$, approximate the marginal average cost when 
5000 televisions have been produced and interpret the result.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $-\$100$, average cost decreases by about $\$100$ when production increases from 5000 to 6000
```


## Exercise 4
Given the demand equation 

$$p + \dfrac{x}{5} = 40,$$

where $p$ represents the price in dollars and $x$ the number of units, determine the elasticity of demand when the price $p$ is equal to \$20 and interpret the result.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $E(20) = 1$, unitary demand and total revenue is maximized 
```


## Exercise 5
The demand for a product is given by 

$$f(p) = 6 + \dfrac{7}{p}.$$ 

Determine the elasticity when $p = 3$ and interpret the result.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $E(3) = \frac{7}{25}$, inelastic demand
```

## Exercise 6
Given the demand equation $p = 12 - \dfrac{x^2}{25}$, determine the price $p$ at which demand is unitary. 

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $p = 8$
```


## Exercise 7
Given the demand equation 

$$p + 5x = 20,$$ 

determine the price $p$ at which total revenue is maximized.


```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $p = 10$
```
