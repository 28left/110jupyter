    "A *Riemann sum* uses rectangles (above right) to approximate the desired area in the following manner.  Start by selecting a value for $n$, which is the number of rectangles. Then break up the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals, each having width $\\Delta x = (b-a)/n$.  Each subinterval corresponds to the base of a rectangle where $\\Delta x$ is the width of the rectangle. Next, pick one value, $x_i$, from each subinterval, and evaluate $f(x_i)$ to determine the height of the corresponding rectangle.\n",
