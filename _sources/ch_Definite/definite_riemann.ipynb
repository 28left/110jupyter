    "There are two images, one to the left and one to the right. In both, there is a horizontal x-axis. On the left, the x-axis has the points a and b marked. On the right, the points a, x one, x two, x three, x four, and b are marked. The graph of the function f(x) is plotted above the axis in each picture. On the left, the area below the graph of f(x), above the x-axis, and between x=a and x=b is shaded yellow. On the right, there are four yellow rectangles of equal width, the bottoms of which break up [a,b] into four subintervals. The first rectangle has lower left hand corner a, contains the point x one, and has height f of x one. The second rectangle contains the point x two and has heigh f of x two. The third rectangle contains the point x three and has height f of x three. The fourth rectangle contains the point x four, has height f of x four, and has lower right hand corner b.\n",

    "A *Riemann sum* uses rectangles (above right) to approximate the desired area in the following manner.  Start by selecting a value for $n$, which is the number of rectangles. Then break up the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals, each having width $\\Delta x = (b-a)/n$.  Each subinterval corresponds to the base of a rectangle where $\\Delta x$ is the width of the rectangle. Next, pick one value, $x_i$, from each subinterval, and evaluate $f(x_i)$ to determine the height of the corresponding rectangle.\n",
