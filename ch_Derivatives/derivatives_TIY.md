# Try It Yourself

## Exercise 1
Find the derivative of the function $f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x$ using the limit definition of the derivative.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $10x - 2$
```


## Exercise 2
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for $f(x)= 3x^2 + 5x^{-2} + 7\sqrt{x}$ using the basic rules of differentiation.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $6x - 10x^{-3} + \frac{7}{2}x^{-1/2}$
```


## Exercise 3
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for 

$$f(x)= \dfrac{7}{x^7} + \dfrac{5}{x^5} + \dfrac{3}{x^3}.$$ 

(Avoid using the quotient rule by rewriting each term so that it involves multplying by a negative power of $x$.) 

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $-49x^{-8} - 25x^{-6} - 9x^{-4}$
```


## Exercise 4
Find the equation of the tangent line of 

$$f(x)=\dfrac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}+x^{\frac{1}{2}}+1}{x^2} \text{ at } x=4.$$  

(Avoid using the quotient rule by dividing each term of the numerator by $x^2$ and then simplifying.) 

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $y = -\frac{9}{64}(x-4) + \frac{11}{16}$
```


## Exercise 5
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for 

$$f(x)= (x^3+6)(x-2)(x+2).$$  

(Simplify $(x-2)(x+2)$ and then apply the product rule.)

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $5x^4 - 12x^2 + 12x$
```

## Exercise 6
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for 

$$f(x)= \sqrt{\dfrac{x^2-1}{x+1}}.$$ 

(Simplify the function before computing the derivative.)

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x-1}}$
```


## Exercise 7
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for 

$$f(x)=\dfrac{17}{(3x+4)^2}.$$ 

(Rewrite the function before differentiating in order to avoid using the quotient rule.)


```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $-\frac{102}{(3x+4)^3}$
```


## Exercise 8
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for $f(x)=5x^4(x^3+6)^{7}$ and simplify your answer.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $5x^3(x^3+6)^6(25x^3 + 24)$
```

## Exercise 9
Evaluate $f'(x)$ for $f(x)=\dfrac{(x^2+4)^5}{(x^6+ 1)^3}$ and simplify your answer.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $\frac{2x(x^2+4)^4(-4x^6-36x^4+5)}{(x^6+1)^4}$
```


## Exercise 10
Evaluate 

$$\displaystyle\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{(1+h)^5-1}{h}.$$

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: $5$
```


## Exercise 11
Draw the graph of a function $f(x)$ that is continuous at $x=a$ but not differentiable at $x=a$. Explain why the function is continuous but not differentiable at this point.

```{dropdown} Show answer
Answer: Consider a graph with a corner or a vertical tangent line
```
