# Implicit Differentiation

Up to this point, we have always been writing our functions in the form

$$y = f(x)$$

to mean that the dependent variable $y$ is a function of the independent variable $x$.  Another way to view $y=f(x)$, is to think of it as an equation relating the two variables $x$ and $y$ where we have explicitly solved for $y$ in terms of $x$.  In general, given an equation relating $x$ and $y$, it is not always going to be the case that $y$ is isolated on one side of the equation, or that it is even possible to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$.  But even in these cases, we can still think of $y$ as a function of $x$.
