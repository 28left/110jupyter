# Functions and Their Graphs

## The Basic Notions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: info
A _**function**_ is a rule that assigns to each element in a set $A$ **one and only one** element in a set $B$.

The set $A$ is called the _**domain**_ of the function.
```

It is customary to denote a function by a letter of the alphabet, such as $f$, $g$, $h$, etc.


```{admonition} Keep in mind
:class: warning

We only do Calculus **on functions**, and all analysis of the functions (i.e., models) is valid **on the domain**.
```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: info

The element in $B$ that $f$ associates with $x$ is written as 

$$f(x)$$ 

(read "$f$ of $x$") and is called the _**value**_ of $f$ at $x$.

\The set of all possible values of $f(x)$ resulting from all the possible values of $x$ in its domain, is called the _**range**_ of $f(x)$.
```


```{admonition} Important
:class: warning

The output $f(x)$ associated with an input $x$ is **unique**:  Each input $x$ must correspond to **one and only one value** of $f$.
```

We have reserved special function designators for common business functions/models (e.g., $d(x)$, $s(x)$, $E(x)$)
